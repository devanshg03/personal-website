          <h2 className="py-4">My 3 Core Driving Values</h2>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            The core values of a person are traits or qualities that represent
            the highest priorities of a person, and they are deeply held
            beliefs, and the core, fundamental driving force of a person. As
            such, these core values are what shape an individual’s personality
            and how a person interacts with the world. There are a plethora of
            personality tests and frameworks online, but as being an ESTP, an
            entrepreneur according to 16 personalities, means that I like to
            interpret things my own way, and that is the same for my core
            values. Instead of having goal-driven values such as ‘Achievement’
            or ‘Wealth’, what drives me is not the end-result but rather the
            journey itself.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Being an ESTP suggests that I am “savvy, energetic and perceptive,
            and truly enjoy living on the edge”, which relates closely with my
            top 3 core values of “Vision & Ambition”, “Continuous Learning” and
            “Creativity”.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I have always enjoyed living life on the edge, making some of my
            life's biggest decisions so for on a whim based solely on my
            intuition. The reasoning behind living on the edge is that I see no
            downside to this since if they decision works out fine, I will have
            no regrets, but it does not, I have an opportunity to learn what I
            did wrong and how I can improve. A recent example of this is my
            decision to pursue a BBA at the University of Hong Kong. In
            secondary school, I studied Biology, Chemistry and Information and
            Communication Technology, thinking that I wanted to go into CS,
            Bioinformatics or even Biotech. However, the last academic year of
            secondary school was 2020-2021, where the market went through one of
            the quickest crashes and recoveries, followed by a market boom.
            Having my last year of high school during the pandemic allowed me to
            have a more flexible schedule, and more time to explore my
            interests. During this time, instead of focusing on my education
            like everyone else, I spent my time learning about finance, stock
            trading and how companies work. However, when it came time to write
            a personal statement for uni, I wrote one up about pursing a degree
            in Computer Science since I had not changed my intent for my career.
            However, at the last moment, I decided to change my program rankings
            and pursue a degree in finance at HKU, with a personal essay about
            Computer Science. I remember my teachers telling me that I should
            pick something related to what I studied in secondary, as it would
            be a safer option, or that I should apply for programs with lower
            entry requirements. However, I decided to stick with my intuition
            and go for a degree in Finance at HKU.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Those that know me well know that I am always working on some
            passion project, whether it be a YouTube channel between the ages of
            11 and 16, or a custom phone case startup (‘CAESD’) during the
            summer after I graduated, or Hong Kong Student Ventures, a
            consulting project am working on, Nola foodtech/consumer tech
            startup or even in student clubs like Entrepreneur Society here at
            HKU. I have always jumped into projects immediately if they have
            aligned with my vision, and purpose.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I believe my top value is vision, and it goes hand-in-hand with
            another value, ambition. The Barret Values Center categorizes
            ambition and vision as separate values. However, I would classify
            these as one, since it is my ambition that supports my vision. I
            believe you be ambitious without a vision, but not have a vision
            without ambition. I have been fortunate to have great parents that
            have supported me in all my endeavors, not telling me to stop making
            YouTube videos every day after school or to focus on getting
            internships rather than working on startups, my parents have
            continuously supported me to grow and become independent. I think
            this ultimately has contributed to how my values are.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I think the reason having a vision and ambition is my top value is
            because I try to find meaning and purpose in what I do. One of the
            high points driven by this value of vision and ambition was when I
            won a startup competition, I remember pitching our idea to the
            judges with my team, knowing that we had been working around the
            clock to have as much of the vision presented as possible, that when
            I was presenting my goal was not to win competition, but instead to
            make them believe in my vision, how we were going to change the
            snack and health industry. It was a formal environment, and I don't
            really like wearing suits, but I think that moment was a high point
            where I was really doing what I believed in. I think this really
            shows that the value of vision and ambition goes deeper than just
            ‘achievement’ according to the Shwart’z value complex, but rather
            having the value of vision and ambition is a way for me to follow
            the underlying desire to make an impact on the world, and help
            improve people’s lives through my skills.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            My second top value is continuous learning. I have always been
            interested in the most random topics. I vividly remember having a
            'Space' book when I was young, and I would read through it learning
            about the most random facts about planets. I think this is partly
            because of the values my parents instilled in me when I was young,
            where they would tell me about different countries in the world, and
            to learn more about the world, and I believe this value also goes
            together with my personality of being entrepreneurial. Since to be
            good leaders we have to be willing to learn and make mistakes.
            Throughout my various ventures, I have learned lots of skills, from
            shooting videos, editing audio and video as well as making graphics
            for my YouTube channel at a young age, to learning to make websites
            during ICT in secondary school. Our final project was supposed to be
            a website, where we could even use no-code tools such as Google
            Sites or Wix.com to make a website, but I wanted to do something
            unique and unconventional, so instead I learned to code HTML and
            CSS, and make a cool website from scratch. Those basic skills have
            been really useful in my development in programming websites and web
            apps, allowing me to test my entrepreneurial ideas really quick by
            building functional prototypes to test my ideas out. Furthermore,
            this value is part of what drives my spontaneous decision-making
            part of my personality, where I was not afraid to make the last
            minute decision to pursue a degree in finance because I knew I was
            willing to be at a disadvantage and learn the basics of economics
            and finance from scratch. Furthermore, as a leader, continuous
            learning enables me to support and motivate my team in times of
            uncertainty, and learn to take up missing roles in a team setting.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            My third top value from the Barret Values Center assessment would be
            entrepreneurial, but I disagree that it is a value, instead I think
            being entrepreneurial is a personality, it is driven my core values
            of vision & ambition as well as continuous learning. As such, I
            would say that my 3rd value would be creativity. I believe my value
            of creativity has shaped me to be the person I am for good or for
            worse, since I find repetitive tasks boring, and always try to find
            creative ways to automate or improve on my workflow. I believe
            creativity comes in all shapes and forms, and I have not been the
            best at drawing or painting like other artistic people. Instead, I
            found my value of creativity in my unconventional solutions to
            problems. An example is when

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Overall, my values tend to be spread unevenly in the stages of
            Psychological Development for the Barret Values Center Assessment,
            as the section on conformity is empty, and the majority of my values
            concentrate on individuating and self-actualizing. According to the
            Schwartz’s Value Circumplex, my values tend to relate closely in the
            areas of self-enhancement and openness to change rather than
            self-transcendence or conservation. This is why I think in the long
            term I would want to work more towards the values of security and
            benevolence, which are usually weaknesses of an ESTP. However, I
            believe the values of benevolence or even universalism will help me
            empathize with people’s problems and enable me to be a better
            entrepreneur.
