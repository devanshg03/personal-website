          <h2 className="py-4">My 3 Core Driving Values</h2>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            A person’s core values are traits or qualities that represent the
            highest priorities of a person, and they have deeply held beliefs
            and the core, fundamental driving force of a person. These core
            values shape an individual’s personality and interactions with the
            world. There are many personality tests and frameworks online, but
            being an ESTP, an entrepreneur according to 16 personalities, means
            that I like to interpret things my way, which is the same as my core
            values. Instead of having goal-driven values such as ‘Achievement’
            or ‘Wealth,’ what drives me is not the end result but rather the
            journey itself.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Being an ESTP suggests that I am “savvy, energetic and perceptive,
            and truly enjoy living on the edge,” which relates closely with my
            top 3 core values of “Vision & Ambition,” “Continuous Learning,” and
            “Creativity.”
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I have always enjoyed living on the edge, making some of my life’s
            most significant decisions on a whim based solely on my intuition.
            The reasoning behind living on the edge is that I see no downside to
            this since if the decision works out fine, I will have no regrets,
            but if it does not, I have an opportunity to learn what I did wrong
            and how I can improve. A recent example is my decision to pursue a
            BBA at the University of Hong Kong. In secondary school, I studied
            Biology, Chemistry, and Information and Communication Technology,
            thinking I wanted to go into Computer Science, Bioinformatics, or
            even Biotech. However, the last academic year of secondary school
            was 2020-2021, when the market went through one of the quickest
            crashes and recoveries, followed by a market boom. Having my last
            year of high school during the pandemic allowed me to have a more
            flexible schedule and more time to explore my interests. During this
            time, instead of focusing on my education like everyone else, I
            learned about finance, stock trading, and how companies work.
            However, when it came time to write a personal statement for uni, I
            wrote one up about pursuing a degree in Computer Science since I had
            not changed my intent for my career. However, at the last moment, I
            decided to change my program rankings and pursue a degree in finance
            at HKU, with a personal essay about Computer Science. I remember
            teachers telling me I should pick something related to what I
            studied in secondary, as it would be a safer option, or apply for
            programs with lower entry requirements. However, I decided to stick
            with my intuition and pursue a degree in Finance at HKU.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Those who know me know that I am always working on a passion
            project, whether it be a YouTube channel between the ages of 11 and
            16 or a custom phone case startup during the summer after
            graduating. More recently, Hong Kong Student Ventures, a pro bono
            consulting project, Nola, a food tech/consumer tech startup, and
            even in student clubs like Entrepreneur Society at HKU. I have
            always jumped into projects immediately if they have aligned with my
            vision and purpose.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I think having a vision and ambition is my top value because I try
            to find meaning and purpose in what I do. One of the high points
            driven by this value of vision and ambition was when I won a startup
            competition. I remember pitching our idea to the judges with my
            team, knowing that we had been working around the clock to have as
            much of the vision presented as possible. When presenting, my goal
            was not to win the competition but to make the judges believe in my
            vision – how we would change the snack and health industry. It was a
            formal environment, and I don’t like wearing suits, but I think that
            moment was a high point where I really did what I believed in. This
            shows that vision and ambition go deeper than just ‘achievement’
            according to the Schwartz value complex. Having the value of vision
            and ambition is a way for me to follow the underlying desire to make
            an impact on the world and how I can help improve people’s lives
            through my skills.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            My second top value is continuous learning. I have always been
            interested in the most random topics. I vividly remember having a
            ‘Space’ book when I was young, and I would read through it, learning
            about the most random facts about planets. I think this is partly
            because of the values my parents instilled in me when I was young;
            they would tell me about different countries and encourage me to
            learn more about the world. I believe this value also goes together
            with my personality of being entrepreneurial. Since to be a good
            leader, a person has to be willing to learn and make mistakes.
            Throughout my various ventures, I have learned many skills, from
            shooting videos, editing audio and video, making graphics for my
            YouTube channel at a young age, and learning to make websites during
            ICT in secondary school. Our final project was supposed to be a
            website where we could even use no-code tools such as Google Sites
            or Wix.com to make a website, but I wanted to do something unique
            and unconventional, so instead, I learned to code HTML and CSS, and
            make a website from scratch. Those basic skills have been
            instrumental in my development in programming websites and web apps,
            allowing me to test my entrepreneurial ideas really quick by
            building functional prototypes to test my ideas out. Furthermore,
            this value is part of what drives the spontaneous decision-making
            part of my personality, where I was not afraid to make the
            last-minute decision to pursue a degree in finance because I was
            willing to learn the basics of economics and finance from scratch.
            Furthermore, as a leader, continuous learning enables me to support
            and motivate my team in times of uncertainty and learn to take up
            missing roles in a team setting.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            My third top value from the Barret Values Center assessment is being
            entrepreneurial, but I disagree that it is a value; instead, being
            entrepreneurial is a personality. It is driven by my core values of
            vision & ambition, and continuous learning. As such, I would say
            that my 3rd value is creativity. My value of creativity has shaped
            me into the person I am, for good or worse, since I find repetitive
            tasks boring and always try to find creative ways to automate or
            improve my workflow. I believe creativity comes in all shapes and
            forms, and I have not been the best at drawing or painting like
            other artistic people. Instead, I found the value of creativity in
            my unconventional solutions to problems. An example is during the
            startup competition mentioned above, where we were unable to source
            a heating element to cook the snacks on time. I instead decided to
            use an LED light strip to represent the heating and snacks being
            baked. Being creative helps me solve problems in unique and
            insightful ways and helps relate to my overall personality as an
            entrepreneur.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Overall, my values tend to be spread unevenly in the stages of
            Psychological Development for the Barret Values Center Assessment,
            as the section on conformity is empty, and the majority of my values
            concentrate on individuating and self-actualizing. According to the
            Schwartz’s Value Circumplex, my values tend to relate closely in the
            areas of self-enhancement and openness to change rather than
            self-transcendence or conservation. This is why I think in the long
            term I would want to work more towards the values of security and
            benevolence, which are usually weaknesses of an ESTP. However, I
            believe the values of benevolence or even universalism will help me
            empathize with people’s problems and enable me to be a better
            entrepreneur.

            achieve my ultimate vision of contributing to society by building
            interesting products to solve problems. After analyzing my values
